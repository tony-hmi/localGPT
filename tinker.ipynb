      "This allows the new edges or faces to be created coincident with the old edges or faces in the set. After \n",

      "The data mapping only involves the part of the model which is being remeshed, and the rest of the model is untouched by \n",

      "For the mapping of element data, all integration points of the old mesh are collected in a point cloud. For each integration \n",
      "point of the new mesh, the closest points in the point cloud are found, and the new values are interpolated from these \n",
      "points. If an integration point in the new mesh is at exactly the same position as a point in the old mesh, then it will obtain \n",

      "Mapping of nodal data is performed in the same way. A point cloud is collected from the nodes of the old mesh, and the \n",

      " Mapping from Old Mesh (Black) to New Mesh (Red)\n",
      "Trimming\n",
      "Trimming is an option to allow the model to be changed during remeshing. It is done using a special loadcase called TRIM. \n",
      "In such a trimming loadcase there is no analysis performed. It automatically triggers a remeshing, and during this remeshing \n",
      "operation the remeshed body is modified. Just as with any remeshing in Marc, the results data are mapped from the old \n",

      "The type of model modification that can be done during trimming is that the remeshed body is intersected by a so-called \n",

      "3-D trimming using shells or tetrahedrons is more general than 2-D. The trimmer can be a general faceted surface, defined \n",
      "from a set of elements, or a rigid or deformable contact body.\n",
      "A faceted surface in Mentat is a special surface type, defining the surface with a mesh of triangles. A faceted surface can be \n",

      "For a trimmer defined as a deformable contact body, the supported element types in the deformable body are all higher and \n",
      "lower order solid and shell elements supported by contact. Beam elements cannot be used as a trimmer. The trimmer \n",

      "then the trimmer will only make a cut with the mid-surface.\n",
      "When using a contact body as a trimmer it is important to remember that the body is a regular contact body in all loadcases \n",
      "except in the trimming loadcase where it is used as a trimmer. As in any contact analysis it is important to use proper contact \n",

      "Using a contact body as a trimmer has the advantage that the contact body can be embedded into the remeshed body during \n",

      "to the remeshed body. For this case it may be advantageous to use the imprint option. This option takes the triangular mesh \n",
      "of the trimmer and makes an imprint of it onto the surface of the remeshed body. This way the new mesh after trimming \n",
      "will match with the mesh of the trimmer. Subsequent contact analysis will give a good fit without spurious stresses due to \n",
      "mesh mismatch. This option should be used with some caution. Suppose it is used with a faceted surface, and the surface \n",
      "has very small facets. Then the new mesh will have the same size at the surface. The imprint of the mesh is exact for triangles \n",
      "that are inside the remeshed body. If the trimmer intersects the surface of the remeshed body, then unless the meshes match \n",
      "up there will be a slight mismatch. The new mesh in this region is adjusted to avoid small or distorted elements.\n",

      "in thermal analyses only. The capability exists for 2-D, axisymmetric and 3-D solid elements.\n",
      "There are seven aspects that control the receding surface calculation in Marc.\n",
      "1. Specifying which surfaces are to undergo recession.\n",
      "The RECEDING SURFACE option is used to specify which surface is to be subjected to recession. For nodes that reside \n",
      "on elements edges (2-D) of faces (3-D) specified by the RECEDING SURFACE, the incremental displacement will be \n",
      "calculated during the recovery phase.\n",
      "2. Specifying the magnitude of the recession rate.\n",
      "The recession rate is based upon either:\n",
      "a. Simple model, that is either a constant, or evaluated by a table.\n",
      "b. Based upon the data given in the SURFACE ENERGY model definition block. \n",
      "c. Specified in UABLATE user subroutine.\n",
      "3. Specifying the direction of the movement of the nodes on the surface.\n",
      "816 Marc Volume A: Theory and User Information\n",
      "The direction of the recession is based upon the normal evaluated at the node. If the ABLATION,1 parameter is used, \n",
      "then the normal is based upon applying a unit distributed load to all external surfaces. The magnitude of the \n",
      "equivalent force is the effective area, and the direction is the normal. This procedure is based upon lower order \n",
      "elements. The result is that at corners of the mesh the calculated normal is not perpendicular to either surface, but \n",
      "a weighted average (based upon the area of the edges).\n",
      "This procedure may lead to more physically reasonable results, as corners tend to be rounded off, but leads to more \n",
      "meshing problems.\n",
      "If the ABLATION,2 parameter is used, then the normal is based upon applying a unit distributed load to those element \n",
      "edges/faces specified by the ABLATION option. This results in the movement of the node lying at the corner to be \n",
      "perpendicular to the surface.\n",
      "If the ABLATION,3 parameter is used, then the direction of recession is based upon the direction of the streamline, \n",
      "assuming that the streamline method is specified on the PYROLYSIS parameter.\n",
      "If the ABLATION,4 parameter is used, then the direction of recession is based upon the direction of the streamline, \n",
      "assuming that the streamline method is specified on the PYROLYSIS parameter. The magnitude of the recession is \n",
      "equal to the projection of the velocity to the streamline.\n",
      "If the ABLATION,5 parameter is used, then the direction of recession is based upon the direction of the side edge. The \n",
      "magnitude of the recession is equal to the projection of the velocity to the side edge. With this parameter the \n",
      "recession behaves as the parameter ablation, 4 but the streamlines here are not required.\n",
      "4. Specifying when remeshing is to occur. \n",
      "Remeshing is based upon three criteria specified via the ADAPT GLOBAL option. The tolerance values are relevant, but \n",
      "not critical unless the recession rate is very high, the time step is large, or the elements are small. The two key issues \n",
      "are: \n",
      "a. The element should not be so distorted at the beginning of the increment that the recession during the \n",
      "increment would lead to an inside-out element. This may lead to an Exit 1005.\n",
      "b. The ablation criteria should only find at most one element along each streamline that should be shaved off. This \n",
      "may lead to an Exit 1111.\n",
      "With this in mind, the following remeshing criteria have been developed:\n",
      "a. Element size reduction – two ratios are calculated. The first is the ratio of the current element edge length \n",
      "divided by the original element edge length. The second ratio is the ratio of the projected current element edge \n",
      "length with the surface normal divided by the projected original element edge length with the surface normal. \n",
      "For a 2-D quadrilateral mesh for each element on the receding surface, two edges are checked; while for 3-D \n",
      "hexahedral mesh, four edges are checked. If any edge satisfies the criteria, remeshing occurs. The recommended \n",
      "value of the tolerance is 0.4.\n",
      "b. Motion of a node. The magnitude of the displacement since the last remeshing is compared with the user-\n",
      "specified tolerance. This method is not recommended.\n",
      "c. The program also uses the previous displacements to predict if in the next increment the element will go inside \n",
      "out. As long as the next increment is similar to the previous increment this is a reasonable procedure. If may fail \n",
      "if the either the recession rate suddenly increases, or if the time step is increased. The user does not need to \n",
      "provide any tolerance value. While in theory, this method could be used exclusively, without the ones \n",
      "CHAPTER 10\n",
      "Nonstructural Procedure Library\n",
      "817\n",
      "mentioned above, this is not recommended, because it leads to very thin elements. Two procedures are used to \n",
      "determine if an element has gone inside out. The first is based upon the Jacobian of the isoparametric shape \n",
      "functions. This method was determined not to be conservative. Hence additionally the area of four triangles (2-\n",
      "D) or volume of eight tetrahedrals is used. \n",
      "5. Specifying the mesher used to create a new mesh\n",
      "Currently the user needs to specify whether the shaver mesher, relax mesher, stretch mesher, or multi-zone mesher \n",
      "is to be used. The shaver, relax, and stretch meshers may be used with quadrilateral and hexahedral elements.  The \n",

      "6. Redefinition of Viewfactors due to Adaptive Meshing\n",
      "If the geometry of the cavity has been defined using geometric entities (curves and surfaces) in the CAVITY DEFINITION\n",
      "model definition option, then when local adaptive meshing (2-D or 3-D) or global adaptive meshing (2-D) occurs, \n",

      "and recalculate the viewfactors.\n",
      "This capability is only available with the Pixel Based Modified Hemi-Cube method.\n",
      "7. Computational Costs\n",
      "Regardless of the method used to calculate the viewfactors, there are two consequences:\n",
      "a. The number of viewfactors becomes large, growing quadratically with the number of radiating surfaces.\n",
      "b. The subsequent calculation in the analysis program is dependent upon the number of viewfactors calculated.\n",
      "The number of viewfactors is reduced because of shadowing effects, but depending upon the procedure used to \n",
      "calculate the viewfactors, this may lead to higher computational costs in calculating them. Because self-shadowing \n",
      "or third surface shadowing is likely, sparse storage techniques are beneficial in storing the view factors. As the data \n",
      "structures required for the view factor calculations are different than what is required for traditional finite element \n",
      "or finite difference calculations, the computation is often put into stand-alone programs.\n",
      "CHAPTER 10\n",
      "Nonstructural Procedure Library\n",
      "859\n",
      "Using finite difference, contour integral, Gaussian integration or direct integration, the number of operations \n",
      "increases quadratically with the number of radiating surfaces. All of these procedures (combined with adaptive \n",
      "approaches or refined meshes) can produce accurate results, but at a clear computational cost. With the Monte \n",
      "Carlo method, the computational cost increases linearly with the number of radiating surfaces and increases linearly \n",
      "with the number of emitting rays. This clearly is beneficial for large models. The problem with the Monte Carlo \n",
      "method is that a large number of rays may be necessary to achieve accurate results (for example, if thin cavities exist).\n",
      "The advantage of the Pixel Based Modified Hemi-Cube method is that the computational costs are linearly \n",
      "dependent on the number of radiating surfaces and linearly dependent upon the number of pixels. The accuracy is \n",
      "dependent upon the number of pixels chosen, and the size/shape of the cube. A very large number of pixels has the \n",
      "ramification that the amount of memory required is increased and the amount of calculations is increased.\n",
      "The number of viewfactors increases the cost of the analysis calculation, because the viewfactor file is larger, and \n",
      "because the bandwidth of the system increases. There are two ways to control the computational costs:\n",
      "a. One can set a tolerance and any viewfactor less than this value will be ignored. This results in radiation being \n",
      "neglected.\n",
      "b. One can set a second tolerance and viewfactors below this number will be treated explicitly as opposed to \n",
      "implicitly. This means that the radiation contribution will be on the right-hand side and not in the operator \n",
      "matrix. This may result in more iterations, but lead to a significant reduction in the size of the operator matrix. \n",

      "In magnetodynamic circuit analysis, circuit coils cannot be massive conductors, and it is assumed that there is no \n",

      "3. There are two types of coils: geometry based and element based. For 3-D problems, the following issues must be \n",
      "noted: \n",
      "a. For geometry based coil, there can be issues with the identification of elements that belong to a coil. Some \n",
      "integration points inside coil geometry may be missed or an integration point outside coil geometry may be \n",
      "selected. Both will produce inaccuracies. Inaccuracy depends on the ratio incorrect integration points divided \n",
      "by total number of integration points in the coil.\n",
      "b. For geometry based coils, a non-conductor element may get included in a coil. Marc writes a warning message \n",
      "for this in the .out file.\n",
      "The remedy is:\n",
      "a. Using element based coil will avoid the above two issues.\n",
      "b. When geometry based coil is used:\n",
      "• The coil path and coil orientation path segments should be similar in size as the element edges of the coil. It is \n",
      "best to have the coil path and the coil orientation path not in the same plane. When there is abrupt change in \n",
      "angle of coil path and coil orientation, replace both by a proper fillet. This ensures smaller volumes of search \n",
      "and reduces chances of incorrect integration points being chosen.\n",
      "• Ensure that the elements lie fully inside or outside the coil geometry. All elements in coil geometry must have \n",

      "In the magnetodynamic analysis, the partially coupled Maxwell’s equations are solved.\n",
      "In the latter two analyses, the equations (fluid flow/structural or electrical/magnetic) are solved simultaneously.\n",
      "Thermal Mechanically Coupled Analysis\n",
      "Many operations performed in the metal forming industry (such as casting, extrusion, sheet rolling, and stamping) can \n",
      "require a coupled thermo-mechanical analysis. The observed physical phenomena must be modeled by a coupled analysis \n",
      "if the following conditions pertain:\n",
      " The body undergoes large deformations such that there is a change in the boundary conditions associated with the \n",
      "heat transfer problem.\n",
      " Deformation converts mechanical work into heat through an irreversible process which is large relative to other \n",
      "heat sources.\n",
      "In either case, a change in the temperature distribution contributes to the deformation of the body through thermal strains \n",
      "and influences the material properties.\n",
      "Marc has a capability that allows you to perform mechanically coupled analysis. This capability is available for all stress \n",
      "elements and for small displacement, total Lagrangian, updated Lagrangian, or rigid plastic analysis.\n",
      "The COUPLE parameter is used to invoke this option. When defining the mesh, if you specify the element as a stress type \n",
      "through the CONNECTIVITY option, Marc generates an associated heat transfer element, if possible. The region having an \n",
      "associated heat transfer element has coupled behavior. If you specify the element as a heat transfer type through the \n",
      "CONNECTIVITY option, that region is considered rigid. Only heat transfer is performed in that region.\n",
      "Marc uses a staggered solution procedure in coupled thermo-mechanical analysis. It first performs a heat transfer analysis, \n",
      "then a stress analysis. Use the CONTROL option to enter the convergence tolerances used in both the structural and heat \n",

      "AUTO STEP is preferred over the TRANSIENT option.\n",
      " Creep coupled analysis: comprises of a transient heat transfer pass and a creep mechanical pass. Fixed stepping can \n",
      "be specified using CREEP INCREMENT and adaptive stepping can use AUTO CREEP or AUTO STEP\n",
      "928 Marc Volume A: Theory and User Information\n",
      " Dynamic coupled analysis: This comprises of a transient heat transfer pass and a dynamic mechanical pass. Fixed \n",
      "stepping can be specified using DYNAMIC CHANGE and adaptive stepping can use AUTO STEP.\n",
      " Harmonic coupled analysis: This can be performed by defining a HARMONIC (Dynamic) structural pass, immediately \n",
      "followed by either a STEADY STATE, TRANSIENT or AUTO STEP loadcase. By using the NO STRUC input on either of \n",
      "these options, this loadcase is a pure thermal loadcase. Moreover, these loadcase options enable the possibility to \n",
      "include viscous heat generation determined in the previous harmonic structural pass. The viscous heat generation \n",
      "conversion factor can be defined using the CONVERT option.\n",
      "Load control and time step control can be specified in either of two ways:\n",
      " A fixed time step/load size can be specified by using the TRANSIENT NON AUTO option, the CREEP INCREMENT\n",
      "option, or the DYNAMIC CHANGE option. In these cases, mechanical loads and deformations are incremental \n",
      "quantities that are applied to each step. Fluxes are total quantities. Time variations for the mechanical and thermal \n",
      "loads can be specified using appropriate TABLE input.\n",
      "When using fixed time steps, the COUPLE CONTROL option may be used to specify that the structural pass will be \n",
      "performed at a lower frequency than the heat transfer pass. This is beneficial when small time steps are required \n",
      "because of temperature dependent thermal properties, phase transformations, or moving boundary conditions \n",
      "such as welding analysis.\n",
      " An adaptive time step/load size can be specified by using the AUTO CREEP option or the AUTO STEP option. In this \n",
      "case, mechanical loads and deformations are entered as the total quantities that are applied over the load set. \n",
      "Fluxes are total quantities. By default, mechanical loads are linearly increased while thermal loads are applied \n",
      "instantaneously.\n",
      " Exercise caution when applying boundary conditions. Use the FIXED DISP, FIXED TEMPERATURE, DISP CHANGE, TEMP \n",
      "CHANGE, or TABLE options for mechanical or thermal boundary conditions, respectively.\n",
      "The COUPLE CONTROL model definition or  history definition option may be used to specify that the frequency of solving \n",
      "the structural pass is less than solving  the heat transfer pass. This is achieved by storing a copy of the temperature field of \n",
      "the last increment where a full thermal-structural solution is obtained and using this temperature field to calculate the \n",
      "thermal strains in the  next full thermal-structural solution increment. This is often cost effective because the temperature \n",
      "dependent  properties, including phase transformations, dictate a small time step for the heat transfer pass, but not \n",
      "necessarily for the (usually computationally more expensive) structural pass.\n",
      "There are two primary causes of coupling. First, coupling occurs when deformations result in a change in the associated \n",
      "heat transfer problem. Such a change can be due to either large deformation or contact. Large deformation effects are \n",
      "coupled into the heat transfer problem only if the LARGE STRAIN or UPDATE parameter is invoked. The gap element in Marc \n",
      "(Type 12) has been modified so that if no contact occurs, the gap element acts as a perfect insulator. When contact does \n",
      "occur, the gap element acts as a perfect conductor.\n",
      "The second cause of coupling is heat generated due to inelastic deformation. The irreversibility of plastic flow causes an \n",
