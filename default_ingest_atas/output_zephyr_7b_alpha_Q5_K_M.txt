> Question:
What is pyrolysis?

> Answer:

Pyrolysis is a thermal decomposition of materials due to high temperature, where the material undergoes an irreversible chemical reaction that produces gases. This process is typically used to generate fuels or chemicals from organic materials without the use of oxygen. The residual material of the reaction is rich in carbon and is often called char or charred material. Pyrolysis can be used for various applications, including thermal protections in rocket motors or reentry bodies, waste management, and production of biofuels and chemicals. In Marc software, pyrolysis can be modeled using three different methods: General, Advanced, and User-defined subroutine (UPYROLSL).

> Question:
What is the Streamline Pyrolysis Model?

> Answer:

The Streamline Pyrolysis Model, also called the Streamline Model, is used in Marc to model the decomposition of materials during pyrolysis through fluid flow. This model assumes that the gas created during the pyrolysis process follows pre-defined streamlines to exit the material. The user must define these streamlines using virtual lines called streamlines in a designated region within the simulation domain. The primary unknown variables for this model are the mass flow rate of pyrolysis gas and temperature, and no transport equation is required since the direction of gas velocity is given by the streamlines. Therefore, the mass density and velocity of the gas cannot be distinguished from each other in this model. For further information on this topic, refer to Marc Volume A: Theory and User Information or the Coupled Diffusion/Thermal analysis chapter for details on the Darcy flow pyrolysis model that uses Darcy's law implemented in the diffusion model to represent gas flow.

This model assumes that the gas created during the pyrolysis process follows predefined streamlines to leave the material. The primary unknown variables for this model are the mass flow rate of pyrolysis gas and temperature, and the direction of the gas velocity is given by virtual lines called streamlines.

> Question:
How can Water Evaporation be handled in the Streamline Pyrolysis model?

> Answer:

In the Streamline Pyrolysis model, water evaporation can be included by defining it as a source term in the mass equation. This can be done using the 'Water Vapor Material' defined in the 'Materials' window of Marc. The water vapor material has its own set of properties (such as mass density and enthalpy) that are specific to water vapor. These properties must be entered correctly for accurate results.

The source term of water drying (i.e., evaporation of liquid water into water vapor) is given by:

-△m·/△t
= -(1 – w) * (ˆ l /△t)

where w represents the degree of drying defined in the 'Water Vapor Material'. The mass flow rate of water vapor is given by:

-m·/△t
= -(1 – w) * (ˆ l /△t) + m·/△t

where the first term represents the mass flow rate of water evaporating into water vapor, and the second term represents the mass flow rate of pre-existing water vapor. This source term is added to the mass equation for the pyrolysis gas in the Streamline Pyrolysis model. It is included as a part of the convective term, where it is represented by the mass flow rate.

Overall, the inclusion of water evaporation allows for more accurate and realistic simulations of thermal processes involving pyrolysis, coking, and water vapor transport in the Streamline Pyrolysis model.

> Question:
How can Coking be handled in the Streamline Pyrolysis model?

> Answer:

In the Streamline Pyrolysis model, Coking can be handled using a one-term Arrhenius model or a linear function of temperature for the evolution of mass fraction of carbon in the pyrolysis gas. The coking is stopped if the temperature decreases, and the last value of carbon retains its value. There are assumptions to deal with the local pressure value, either neglecting it by setting it equal to 1 or assuming it to be equal to the external pressure. The rate of pyrolysis and coking can also be controlled based on the advancement variable of pyrolysis at that location. The streamline model yields a conservation of mass equation with source terms for decomposition, carbon deposit, and water drying. The drying of initial water vapor occurs before pyrolysis. Coking leads to an increase in density due to redeposited carbon in the solid. No information is provided regarding the user subroutine UCOKSL for coking models, but it can be defined if desired.

> Question:
What is formulation of the Surface Energy Balance?

> Answer:

The Surface Energy Balance formulation is presented as:

enthalpy flow associated with energy given to the surface by impacting particles (fraction of conversed kinetic energy)

Radiative balance:

balance of radiative heat flux, resulting from absorption and emission.

Conduction:

apparent conductive flow within the material.

H: each time that a upper-case enthalpy and the so-called sensible enthalpy. If we refer only to the sensible part, a lower-case enthalpy is used for an enthalpy. J.kg 1– .

The equation of each term in the Surface Energy Balance is:

Convection:

 

H Hrec He

–

T

s  

803

with:

H = sensible enthalpy flux at the surface (J.m-2.s-1)

Hrec = convective heat transfer coefficient, homogeneous with surface mass flow rate (kg.m-2.s-1)

He = convection enthalpy transported by external flow, parallel to the surface at the edge (J.kg-1)

Ts = surface temperature (K)

Different terms in the Surface Energy Balance are represented below:

Ablation due to external gases:

The mass flow rate of material thermochemically ablated by external gases is equal to:

m·, s th g

= M B'cM m·, where:

M = normalized mass flow rate of solid material thermochemically ablated by external gases (kg.m-2.s-1)

B'c = diffusion coefficient (m2.s-1)

Ablation due to impacting particles:

The mass flow rate of material thermochemically ablated by the action of impacting particles is equal to:

m·, s th p

.

Radiative balance:

Balance of radiative heat flux resulting from absorption and emission.

Conduction:

apparent conductive flow within the material.

The total enthalpy (i.e., energy content) per unit mass for any of the materials is the sum of the sensible enthalpy and the enthalpy of formation:

Hx = + hx Hx, where:

hx = sensible enthalpy (J.kg-1)

Tref = reference temperature (K)

cpx = specific heat at constant pressure (J.kg-1.K-1)

The enthalpy of the solid in volume element dV can be written as:

sHsdVs =  ˆ cHcx + ˆ vHv 1 x–  dV

The enthalpy of the gas in the pores of volume element dV can be written as:

gHgdVg = ˆ gHgdVg, where:

s = volumetric mass fraction of solid (kg.m-3)

c = volumetric mass fraction of condensed product (kg.m-3)

v = volumetric mass fraction of vapor (kg.m-3)

g = mass fraction of gas in pores (kg.kg-1 solids)

HsdVs = enthalpy per unit volume of solid (J.m-3)

Hcx, Hvx, and hx are calculated following the specific heat laws for each species. 

The Surface Energy Balance is summarized by this equation:

enthalpy flow associated with energy given to the surface by impacting particles (fraction of conversed kinetic energy)

Radiative balance:

balance of radiative heat flux, resulting from absorption and emission.

Conduction:

apparent conductive flow within the material.

enthalpy flow associated with liquid phase removal at the surface due to liquid products formed at the surface of the material by several mechanisms (phase change of a component of the material, oxidation at the surface of gaseous products coming from the , for instance), and the blowing of these phases:

m·1H1m1 = m·1x t  where:

m·1 = mass flow rate of liquid product formed at the surface of the material, and blowed out by the action of the external flow or other mechanisms (kg.m-2.s-1)

Ts = surface temperature (K)

H1 = specific enthalpy of the liquid phase 'l' taken into account in, evaluated at the surface temperature Ts (J.kg-1).

> Question:
How can surfaces recession be modelled?

> Answer:

Surfaces recession can be modelled using three methods in Marc: Simple, User Sub. uablate, and Advanced methods. In the simple method, a constant or table-defined rate of normal recession to the surface is entered. The advanced method retrieves the recession rate from mass flow rates of solid material and/or recession rates obtained from Surface Energy data. A distinction is made between ablation due to external gases and impacting particles and erosion due to mechanical effects driven by the mass density of impacting particles or intense erosion. The user can also specify a displacement normal to the surface via the User Sub. uablate method. Wherever the recession rate calculation takes place, a displacement normal to the surface is calculated, and then it's kept normal to the surface (Receding Surfaces, Streamlines) or projected to the streamlines (Streamlines (projected)) or side edges of surface elements based on user preference. The Surface Recession option allows for modelling the elimination of material at the surface in Marc, which is particularly useful for rocket motor analyses that model ablation due to chemical effects or erosion due to mechanical effects.

> Question:
What kind of meshers can be used when modelling surface recession?

> Answer:

Several meshers are available for modelling surface recession in Marc, including:

1. Stretch Mesher: This is a 2-D meshing technique that allows the creation of high-quality stretched elements suitable for regions undergoing recession. It can be used to define the direction of surface nodes displacement during the recession process.

2. Shave Mesher: Also a 2-D meshing technique, this involves shaving off layers of material from the solid in regions where recession occurs. This is useful for modelling complex geometries and can also be used to create streamline regions in 3-D models.

3. Surface Recession Mesher: This is a specialized mesher designed specifically for modelling surface recession. It can be used to generate high-quality meshes with a greater level of control over the placement of nodes and elements.

4. Streamline Model: This is a technique used in conjunction with the shaver mesher to define the direction of the streamlines normal to the surface in areas where recession occurs. It can improve mesh quality and reduce distortion problems.

5. Relax Mesher: This is a 2-D and 3-D meshing technique that improves mesh quality by shifting nodes. It can be used to correct any distortion problems that may occur during the recession process.

In general, the choice of meshers will depend on the specific needs of the analysis being performed, as well as the geometry of the model being modelled.

page_content='Either mesher may be used with either lower order or higher order elements for both 2-D and 3-D problems. When using higher order elements, two considerations are made.\n\na. During the recession itself the midside node on the surface is positioned such that the surface geometry is linear within and element, bi-linear for 3-D geometries. While this is not strictly consistent with the idea of higher order elements, it resulted in less distortion problems. Temperature fields are still quadratic. The midside nodes on the edges perpendicular to the surface that are in the interior of the element are adjusted such that they are mid-edge. This was done to make sure the quadratic shape functions did not break down.\n\nb.

Region geometry.\n\nFor the streamline model the element edges normal to the surface in theory should follow the streamline behavior; i.e., be normal to the surface. This is also advantageous from a surface recession perspective. When the recession, which by default is normal to the surface, is not aligned with the element edges, addition mesh distortion occurs. To overcome this problem a projection procedure can be requested. This is only available in conjunction with the shaver mesher, and is still not as good as creating a good mesh to begin with. It is highly advantageous to have initially a good mesh.\n\nExamples\n\n1. Axisymmetric analysis with edges not perpendicular to surface).
