> Question:
What is pyrolysis?

> Answer:
Pyrolysis is a thermal decomposition process that occurs when materials are subjected to high temperatures in the absence or with limited oxygen supply. During pyrolysis, the material undergoes an irreversible chemical reaction that results in the formation of gases and solid residue called char or charred material. The process is endothermic, meaning it requires energy input, and materials that are able to thermally decompose by pyrolysis are often used as thermal protectors in rocket motors or reentry bodies due to their insulating properties. There are three models available in the software Marc to represent pyrolysis decomposition processes: one term Arrhenius model, two term Arrhenius model, and streamline model. Each phase of the pyrolysis, including virgin material, charred material, and gas, requires a separate material definition with specific properties such as mass density, specific heat, thermal conductivity, enthalpy of formation, reference temperature, porosity, permeability, elastic properties, thermal expansion coefficient, and pore pressure-stress effect coefficient (for the solid phases) or specific heat, enthalpy of formation, reference temperature, dynamic viscosity, and molecular weight (for the gas phase). The pyrolysis definition combines these materials into a complete material and defines rules for how properties are combined at different stages of pyrolysis. The advanced method represents pyrolysis through decomposition of the solid material and transport of the produced gas through the solid material, while the one term Arrhenius model considers a single exponential term to describe the pyrolysis reaction rate. The software provides an option to define an alternate model for pyrolysis using the UPYROLSL user subroutine. Coking, or the formation of carbon deposits, is another process associated with pyrolysis and is governed by complex sets of kinetically controlled chemical reactions. The phenomena are neither well understood nor are the associated constants accurately known.

> Question:
What is the Streamline Pyrolysis Model?

> Answer:

The Streamline Pyrolysis Model is a technique used to describe the decomposition of solid material due to thermal processes in materials science and engineering simulations. It takes into account the gas created during pyrolysis, as opposed to other models that ignore it or treat it differently. In this model, the direction of the gas velocity is prescribed by virtual lines called streamlines, which are defined by the user in a specific region called a streamline region. As the gas direction is predefined, no transport equation is required in the model, and the mass density and velocity of the gas cannot be distinguished from each other. The primary unknown variables in this model are the mass flow rate of pyrolysis gas and the temperature. This model assumes that the gas follows predefined streamlines to leave the material, and it is available for planar, axisymmetric, and solid elements using either linear or quadratic interpolation functions. The user must identify which element contains streamlines. The Streamline Pyrolysis Model is mandatory to use when the 'streamline fluid flow pyrolysis model' is selected in Marc, but it can be used in combination with other meshers like the stretch mesher and multizone mesher. However, the definition of a streamline region is still required. The Darcy's law pyrolysis model is an alternative technique used when gas transport occurs based on pore pressure gradients rather than predefined streamlines.

> Question:
How is the Streamline Pyrolysis Model supported in Marc-Mentat?

> Answer:

The Streamline Pyrolysis Model in Marc-Mentat is supported through the use of advanced methods to describe the decomposition of solid materials due to pyrolysis. In this model, the direction of gas velocity during pyrolysis is prescribed by virtual lines called streamlines, which the user must define in the Toolbox -> Streamline regions menu. Unlike other models, the mass density and velocity of gas cannot be distinguished from each other, and the variable describing the pyrolysis gas in this model is its mass flow rate. The model consists of the mass equation and the heat equation with an interaction term representing the energy consumed by the pyrolysis reaction and a divergent term for the mass flow rate of gas. This model can be selected through the PYROLYSIS parameter, which determines whether the Streamline or Darcy flow model is used in coupled diffusion/thermal analysis. The current help provides detailed information on the General Properties and Other Properties frames of this model, as well as the Data Method, Water Drying Model, and Coking Model options that will be explained in separate helps. Overall, the Streamline Pyrolysis Model in Marc-Mentat enables users to accurately simulate pyrolysis processes by taking into account both the thermochemical decomposition of materials and the transport of gaseous products.

> Question:
How can Water Evaporation be handled in the Streamline Pyrolysis model?

> Answer:

Water evaporation is included in the energy equation of the streamline pyrolysis model through an enthalpic term. The equation becomes:



ˆ

s i *, cpi

. *T



+



ˆ

ˆ

cs p*,

+

, s c c*, t

–

Hs p vc, ,



that represents the energy consumed by the pyrolysis reaction.

 An enthalpic term

–

ˆ ------------------- Hc* Hg p, 

, s c c*, t

–



that represents the energy consumed by the coking reaction.

 An enthalpic term

ˆ -------- Hv Hl t

l



–



that represents the energy consumed by the evaporation of the water vapor.

In this enthalpic term, 'Hv' is the latent heat of vaporization of water and 'Hl' is the latent heat of fusion of ice. The equation accounts for the fact that when water evaporates, it absorbs heat from its surroundings, which must be taken into account in the energy balance. When water dries during pyrolysis, this term becomes active to calculate the corresponding energy consumption due to the evaporation process.

The user can input the required properties for water vapor, such as density and diffusion coefficient, in the Water Vapor Material section under Fluid Properties in the Streamline Pyrolysis Model. These properties are then used to calculate the mass flow rate of water vapor through the source term of decomposition '– ˆ s p*, --------------- Hg p,  t', which represents the energy consumed by the evaporation of water vapor.

In summary, water evaporation is handled in the Streamline Pyrolysis model through an enthalpic term that takes into account the latent heat of vaporization and a source term of decomposition to calculate the corresponding mass flow rate of water vapor.

> Question:
How can Coking be handled in the Streamline Pyrolysis model?

> Answer:


In the Streamline Pyrolysis model, Coking is handled using a kinetic equation that governs the rate of carbon deposition due to coking reactions between gases and porous solid. The quantity K˜_cg represents the mass fraction of carbon in the pyrolysis gas at any time t, and it evolves according to:

  ∂K˜_cg / ∂t = kc_E * exp[(Eac - P) / (RT)]^n * n * c * (K˜_cg * K˜_cgE - K˜_cgE),

where kc_E is the kinetic coefficient for coking reactions, Eac is the activation energy, n is the order of reaction, R is the gas constant, T is the temperature, P is the pressure (assumed to be either 1 or the external pressure), and c is the concentration of cokable species in the pyrolysis gas.

The quantity K˜_cgE represents the mass fraction of carbon in the pyrolysis gas at chemical equilibrium, which can be calculated using standard thermochemical calculation software. The Coking Model option is described in detail in a separate help document (see "Water Drying Model and Coking Model" in the Streamline Pyrolysis model's menu).

It should be noted that if the pressure dependence is neglected (i.e., P=1), then there is no inverse coking reaction that would lead to an increase of carbon in the pyrolysis gas, as stated in the help document for Simple and Advanced Pyrolysis models (see "General Properties" section). However, if the pressure dependence is taken into account (i.e., P=external pressure), then a decrease in pressure can cause carbon redeposition on the solid surface due to decreased solubility of cokable species in the pyrolysis gas.

In summary, Coking is modeled using a kinetic equation for carbon deposition that takes into account the temperature dependence and concentration of cokable species, with an option to specify either pressure independence or dependence on external pressure. This Coking Model allows for a more realistic prediction of the final product properties after pyrolysis, such as residual solid composition and carbon content in the gas phase.

> Question:
What is formulation of the Surface Energy Balance?

> Answer:

The Surface Energy Balance formulation in the context of Surface Energy from Marc Volume A: Theory and User Information is summarized by the following equation:

Enthalpy flow associated with energy given to the surface by impacting particles (fraction of converted kinetic energy) + Radiative balance (balance of radiative heat flux resulting from absorption and emission) - Conduction (apparent conductive flow within the material) - Enthalpy flow due to external chemical species diffusion effects + Enthalpy flow due to thermochemical ablation by gases + Enthalpy flow due to internal thermal decomposition products flow - Enthalpy flow due to blowing of gaseous products + Enthalpy flow due to thermochemical ablation by impacting particles + Thermal effects of mechanical erosion by impacting particles - Enthalpy flow due to mechanical removal of liquid phases at the surface = 0

The contributions to this balance are:

1. Convection (heat transfer coefficient multiplied by the normalized mass flow rate of solid material thermochemically ablated by external gases, with or without blowing correction)
2. Diffusion (mass flow rate of material thermochemically ablated by external gases due to molecular diffusion)
3. Radiative balance (balance of radiative heat flux resulting from absorption and emission)
4. Conduction (apparent conductive flow within the material)
5. Decomposition (enthalpy flow due to internal thermal decomposition products flow)
6. Ablation by gases (mass flow rate of material thermochemically ablated by external gases)
7. Flow (enthalpy flow due to blowing of gaseous products)
8. Ablation by particles (mass flow rate of material thermochemically ablated by the action of impacting particles)
9. Surface recession due to mechanical erosion by impacting particles (thermal effects of mechanical erosion by impacting particles)
10. Mechanical removal of liquid phases at the surface (enthalpy flow due to mechanical removal of liquid phases at the surface)

The heat flux calculations are performed for both the surface and wall regions, and the Surface Energy Balance is coupled with the conductive heat flux into the material. The contributions not relevant to the specific analysis or model can be set to zero.

> Question:
How can surfaces recession be modelled?

> Answer:

Surfaces recession can be modelled in Marc using the Surface Recession option, which is available under the Job -> Analysis Option menu. The user can choose from three methods to model surface recession: simple, advanced, or user subroutine (uablate). In all cases, a recession rate is calculated and provides a nodal displacement normal to the surface, which is then projected to the chosen method based on the 'Normal' setting in the Analysis Option menu.

The simple method involves directly entering a constant recession rate or retrieving it from a table (with units consistent with [m/s]). The advanced method allows for the distinction between ablation caused by external gases and erosion caused by mechanical effects, such as impacting particles. In this case, the user can enter mass flow rates of solid material being thermochemically or mechanically ablated, which are then divided by the mass density of the solid to obtain the recession rate (also with units consistent with [m/s]). The total recession is the sum of ablation due to external gases and impacting particles' erosion.

The user subroutine (uablate) method allows for a customized recession rate input, using units consistent with [m/s].

Regardless of which method is used, wherever the calculation of the recession rate takes place, a recession rate at the nodes is calculated, and the normal displacement is applied. The displacement can then be kept normal to the surface or projected to streamlines or side edges of surface elements. The chosen projection method depends on the 'Normal' setting in the Analysis Option menu.

It's important to note that the direction of movement for surface nodes during recession should be specified using the RECEDING SURFACE option, which is available under the Job -> Analysis Option menu. Only surfaces defined with this option will experience node displacement during recession analysis. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure a suitable mesh since the recession projection depends on the mesh's streamline construction and pertinence.

In summary, Marc provides three ways to model surface recession: simple, advanced, or user subroutine (uablate). The method used will depend on the specific application, such as rocket motor analyses for modelling ablation due to chemical effects or mechanical effects like erosion caused by impacting particles. Regardless of which method is chosen, a recession rate at the nodes is calculated and provides a normal displacement that can be projected based on the 'Normal' setting in the Analysis Option menu. The user must also specify surfaces for recession using the RECEDING SURFACE option and ensure a suitable mesh for proper projection of the recession.

> Question:
What kind of meshers can be used when modelling surface recession?

> Answer:

There are several meshers that can be used when modelling surface recession in Marc:

1. Relax mesher: Improves the mesh by shifting nodes, available for both 2-D and 3-D solids.

2. Shave mesher: Deletes layers of a region where recession takes place, available for both 2-D and 3-D solids.

3. Stretch mesher: Available for both 2-D and 3-D solids.

4. Multi-zone mesher: Special mesher for streamline regions, available for both 2-D and 3-D solids.

5. Overlay hexahedral mesher: Limited capabilities, available only for 3-D solids.

When using higher order elements during recession analysis, two considerations are made: the midside node on the surface is positioned such that the surface geometry is linear within and element, bi-linear for 3-D geometries; and the remeshing process itself is based upon using lower order elements, and the midside nodes are then repositioned to the midpoints.

For shell analysis, the Patran MOM (Mesh on Mesh) surface mesher can be used, which supports both triangles and quadrilaterals with full support for mesh density control and geometry preservation including hard and soft entities. This mesher also has full support for loads and boundary conditions that can be applied to the interior of the mesh, but it does not support trimming and crack propagation.

When using the MoM (Mesh on Mesh) mesher for quadrilateral analysis, it may create some triangles, which are treated as collapsed quadrilaterals. 

In summary, a variety of meshers can be used when modelling surface recession in Marc, with varying capabilities and limitations depending on the type of analysis being performed.

During the recession itself the midside node on the surface is positioned such that the surface geometry is linear within and element, bi-linear for 3-D geometries. While this is not strictly consistent with the idea of higher order elements, it resulted in less distortion problems. Temperature fields are still quadratic. The midside nodes on the edges perpendicular to the surface that are in the interior of the element are adjusted such that they are mid-edge.

Region geometry.\n\nFor the streamline model the element edges normal to the surface in theory should follow the streamline behavior; i.e., be normal to the surface. This is also advantageous from a surface recession perspective. When the recession, which by default is normal to the surface, is not aligned with the element edges, addition mesh distortion occurs. To overcome this problem a projection procedure can be requested. This is only available in conjunction with the shaver mesher, and is still not as good as creating a good mesh to begin with. It is highly advantageous to have initially a good mesh.\n\nExamples\n\n1. Axisymmetric analysis with edges not perpendicular to surface).
